        <h2>Scene: Emergency Meeting in the Art Club Room</h2>
        <p>Tomoya called everyone to the art club room at 3 o'clock for an urgent meeting, ensuring that no one else would be present. The atmosphere was tense as the group settled in, all aware of the weight of their situation.</p>
        <p><strong>Tomoya:</strong> “I checked every painting in the art club,But I didn’t find any that resemble the one from the article. This is really bad news.”</p>
        <p>Kaito leaned forward, concern etched on his face.</p>
        <p><strong>Kaito:</strong>“It’s been several days since we started our research, and we’re getting nowhere. At this rate, any day one of us could be next.”</p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong>(nodded, her anxiety palpable)“We have to find a way to break this curse before it claims another victim. We can’t let fear paralyze us.”</p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong>“We need to keep looking. There has to be something we’re missing, some clue that can lead us to the answer.”</p>
        <p><strong>Yamato:</strong>“Has anyone else noticed how Hiroshi’s behaviour has changed since the curse reactivated? He hasn’t been involved in any activities, and he avoids talking about it.” </p>
        <p><strong>Kaito:</strong>(nodded)“Yeah, I haven’t seen him at any club activities either since that day.”</p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong>(eyes widened)“So, you guys are saying Hiroshi might be connected to this curse?”</p>
        <p><strong>Tomoya:</strong> “Who knows? But we have to find out what’s really going on with Hiroshi. If he’s somehow connected to the curse or knows something more, we need to confront him.”</p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong> “I agree. His sudden withdrawal from everything isn’t just a coincidence. It’s like he’s hiding something… or maybe he’s scared too.”</p>
        <p><strong>Kaito:</strong> “If he’s involved, we have to be careful. What if confronting him puts us in more danger?”</p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong>(nodded)“We need a plan. We can’t go in blindly. We should try to find out more about Hiroshi first, maybe look into his recent activities or see if anyone else has noticed anything strange.”</p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong>“Let’s split up again. Some of us can keep investigating Hiroshi quietly, while the others keep searching for that missing painting. If there’s any link between the two, we need to find it fast.”</p>
        <p>Everyone exchanged uneasy glances but nodded in agreement. The clock was ticking, and with each passing day, the curse’s next victim drew closer.</p>
        <p>As the group left the art club room, Shin felt the growing weight of responsibility pressing down on him. The mystery of the curse, Hiroshi’s strange behaviour, and the missing painting all seemed to intertwine into a dark web. There had to be a way to unravel it—but time was running out.</p>

    <div class="scene">
        <h2>Scene:  An Unexpected Death</h2>
        <p>In the morning, the atmosphere in the classroom was tense as students whispered among themselves, wondering why Ren-sensei hadn’t arrived yet. It had been fifteen minutes since the class was supposed to start.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, Hikaru-sensei entered the room, a sombre expression on his face.</p>
        <p><strong>Hikaru-sensei:</strong> “From today onwards, I will be your homeroom teacher”</p>
        <p>A girl named Naomi Yamaguchi raised her hand, concern evident in her eyes. “But, Sensei, where is Ren-sensei?”</p>
        <p><strong>Hikaru-sensei:</strong>(face turned pale)“This morning, Ren-sensei and I were talking in the staff room when... suddenly, blood came out of his mouth. Before I could do anything, he collapsed and died right in front of my eyes.”</p>
        <p>Gasps echoed through the classroom as the weight of Hikaru’s words sank in. The reality of the curse hung heavily in the air, leaving everyone in stunned silence.</p>        
    </div>

    <div class="scene">
        <h2>Scene: The First Victim</h2>
        <p>Yamato and Ema quietly observed Hiroshi's behaviour as they walked alongside him, sharing worried glances. Meanwhile, Tomoya, Shin, and Kaito scoured the school in search of the mysterious painting.</p>
        <p>One day, as Hiroshi made his way home, he suddenly stopped and turned to face Yamato and Ema.</p>
        <p><strong>Hiroshi:</strong>“You both can come out. I already know about you two. Why are you following me for so many days?”</p>
        <p><strong>Yamato:</strong>(hesitate)“It’s not like we were following you, we were just—”</p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong>(serious)“I want to ask you about your sudden change in behaviour. Do you know anything about the curse or are you connected to it in any way? You need to share with us for everyone’s safety.”</p>
        <p><strong>Hiroshi:</strong>“You guys… you’re overthinking everything….. What do you think when did this started curse?”</p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong>“On April 16th, with the death of Aiko Yoshida.”</p>
        <p><strong>Hiroshi:</strong>(shook his head)“No… it started on April 2nd.”</p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong>(shocked)“What?! What are you saying? Then who was its first victim?”</p>
        <p><strong>Hiroshi:</strong>(expression darkened)“The first victim is Takashi… Mia Takashi, president of the student council.”</p>
        <p><strong>Yamato:</strong>“Takashi? That means she’s your sister!”</p>
        <p>Hiroshi nodded, his gaze dropping.</p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong>(voice softened)“Oh… I see. So, this is the reason for your sudden change in behaviour…”</p>
        <p>Just then, Ema’s phone rang, startling them. She looked at the screen and saw it was Shin. “It’s Shin,” she said, putting the call on speaker.</p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong>(voice trembled)“Ema, is Tomoya with you? Or do you see him?”</p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong>(heart racing)“No, neither he is with us nor we have seen him. But what happened, Shin? He was supposed to be with you,”</p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong>“He was with us, but suddenly he disappeared. We tried calling him multiple times, but he’s not picking up!”</p>
        <p><strong>Hiroshi:</strong>(eyes widened)“What?! Guys, let’s hurry back to school. We’ll find him together!”</p>        
    </div>

    <div class="scene">
        <h2>Scene: The Unseen Terror</h2>
        <p>As they hurried toward the school, Ema glanced at Hiroshi</p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong>“Why didn’t you tell us about this earlier?”</p>
        <p><strong>Hiroshi:</strong> “I was... deeply affected by it. I couldn't bring myself to talk about it.”</p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong>“I understand how it feels to lose someone close to you... Never mind…. I just hope Tomoya is alright.”</p>
        <p>As they approached the school gate, the atmosphere felt heavier. Just as Yamato stepped inside, a sudden thud echoed in front of them—a lifeless body fell to the ground. Ema screamed in horror, her voice piercing the air.</p>
        <p><strong>Yamato:</strong>(face paled)“Is... is it Tomoya?”</p>
        <p>Hearing Ema’s scream, Shin and Kaito rushed over, their hearts pounding.</p>
        <p>Other students who were still at school gathered around the horrifying scene, murmuring in shock and fear. </p>
        <p>As Yamato knelt down beside the body, his breath hitched. The blood-soaked clothes were unmistakable.</p>
        <p><strong> Yamato:</strong>(whispered)“It’s... Tomoya”</p>
        <p>Ema gasped in horror, taking a step back. “No, not him...” Her voice broke as she tried to process the sight of her friend lying there, lifeless.</p>
        <p>Shin and Kaito arrived, rushing over. The moment they saw Tomoya’s body, Shin’s knees gave way, and he collapsed beside him. “Tomoya...” His voice cracked with disbelief. </p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong>(eyes filled with tears)“Why didn’t we find him sooner?”</p>
        <p><strong>Yamato:</strong>(shook his head, anger and grief mixing in his expression)“This curse... it’s out of control. It’s not stopping.”</p>
        <p><strong>Kaito:</strong>(clenched his fists) “We were too late.”</p>
        <p>Hiroshi stood back, watching the scene unfold, his face pale but resolute. “The curse won’t stop unless we do something. Tomoya won’t be the last unless we figure out how to end this.”</p>
    </div>

    <div class="scene">
        <h2>Scene: The Festival's Dark Secret</h2>
        <p>After the shock of the day's events, Ema felt an urgent need to seek answers. Determined, she made her way to the school library, her mind racing with the possibility that something crucial was still missing.</p>
        <p>"Kaigo-sensei," she called out as she hurried over to him, her voice tense with worry. "I need to tell you everything that's happened so far."</p>
        <p>She quickly recounted the strange occurrences, the reactivation of the curse, the mysterious deaths, and Tomoya's recent disappearance. Kaigo-sensei listened intently, his face growing more serious with each detail. When she finished, he was silent for a moment, thinking deeply.</p>
        <p><strong>Kaigo sensei:</strong>"I believe I may remember something important. The curse... It started around the time of the school’s annual festival, 60 years ago. Every club was desperate to win first place that year. There was an intense rivalry—each club was pushing itself to the limit, determined to put on the best performance."</p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong>(eyes widened)“So, you think it has something to do with that festival?”</p>
        <p><strong>Kaigo sensei:</strong>(nodded) “It seems likely. Every club was involved, and tensions were high. But what exactly happened during that festival... I don’t recall. It was a long time ago.”</p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong>“There must be some connection. If the curse started around that festival, then something must have triggered it. What exactly caused this rivalry to turn into a curse?”</p>
        <p>Kaigo-sensei gestured toward the back of the library, where old school records were stored.</p>
        <p><strong>Kaigo sensei:</strong>"You might find answers in the school history. I recommend starting there. It contains information on every festival the school has ever held. Perhaps you'll find what you're looking for."</p>
        <p>Without wasting another second, Ema hurried toward the dusty shelves. She pulled out a thick, weathered book that chronicled the school’s past events, flipping through its pages with nervous anticipation. As she reached the section detailing the festival 60 years ago, a chilling realization washed over her.</p>
        <p>The pages described how a boy, a member of the art club, had worked tirelessly to complete a masterpiece for the festival, but due to jealousy and rivalry, it had been vandalized right before the event. The boy, heartbroken and humiliated, had passed away soon after. That tragic incident had marked the beginning of the curse.</p>
        <p>Ema froze as she read the final lines of the entry, her heart pounding. This was it—the origin of the curse. The boy's anguish had manifested into something far more dangerous, and it had been waiting, dormant, until now.</p>
        <p>With trembling hands, she closed the book and took a deep breath, trying to process what she had just learned. The words replayed in her mind: Ken Tanaka, a boy with dreams cut short by cruelty. The anguish he experienced had transformed into a curse that now plagued the school, claiming a life every fourteen days.</p>
        <p>Desperate to understand more about Ken, Ema glanced around the library for Kaigo-sensei. Spotting him near the reference section, she hurried over.</p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong>"Kaigo-sensei, I need to know more about Ken Tanaka. Is there another book or resource that can help me learn about him?"</p>        
        <p><strong>Kaigo sensei:</strong>(concerned expression)"Yes, there is an art club history book that may provide more details about Ken's life and the events surrounding the festival. It should be on the shelf beside the one you just read."</p>
        <p>Ema nodded, her heart racing with anticipation. She quickly made her way to the shelf and found the book labelled <strong>"Art Club Archives"</strong> With a sense of urgency, she opened it and began to read through the pages.</p>
        <p>As she flipped through, Ema uncovered the story of Ken's dedication to art and the pride he took in his work. The pages detailed how he had poured his heart into creating a masterpiece for the upcoming annual festival, determined to prove himself and earn recognition from his peers. However, the tone shifted as she read about the relentless bullying he endured from classmates who sought to undermine him.</p>
        <p>Ema’s voice trembled as she read aloud, “Despite his talent, Ken faced mockery and ridicule. One fateful day, just before the festival, a group of bullies destroyed his painting, leaving him devastated. Overwhelmed by despair, Ken succumbed to his heart condition later that night. His unfulfilled dreams and pain seemed to echo through the walls of the school, leading to the curse that began that day.”</p>
        <p>The gravity of the situation settled heavily on Ema’s shoulders. She now understood how this curse had originated, fuelled by Ken’s anguish.</p>
        <p>“Ken…,” she whispered to herself, “we need to honour your memory and find a way to stop this curse.”</p>
        <p>After collecting her thoughts, Ema quickly pulled out her phone and dialled Shin's number. As she waited for him to pick up, her heart raced with anticipation.</p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong>"Ema? What’s going on?”</p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong>“Shin, you need to gather everyone and come to the library. I’ve discovered something important about the curse!”</p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong>“Got it. We’ll be there as soon as we can!”</p>
        <p>Ema hung up, feeling a mixture of hope and dread.</p>
        <p>Minutes later, Shin arrived with Yamato, Kaito, and Hiroshi, all looking anxious and ready for answers. Ema gestured for them to gather around the table where she had been studying.</p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong>(take a deep breath) “Okay, everyone, listen up, I found some crucial information in the school history books about the curse and its origin.”</p>
        <p><strong>Kaito:</strong>“What did you find?”</p>
        <p>Ema flipped open the pages of the book she had been reading and pointed to the passage.</p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong>“This curse began with a boy named Ken Tanaka. He was an incredibly talented artist, and he dedicated himself to creating a masterpiece for our school’s annual festival. But just before the event, bullies destroyed his painting, which broke his spirit.”</p>
        <p><strong>Yamato:</strong>“That’s terrible. But how does that connect to the curse?”</p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong>“After Ken’s painting was ruined, he was heartbroken. He died that night due to a heart condition, and his pain didn’t just vanish. It turned into a curse that has haunted this school ever since, claiming a life every fourteen days.”</p>
        <p>A hush fell over the group as the weight of Ema’s words sunk in.</p>
        <p><strong>Hiroshi:</strong>“So, the deaths… they’re tied to Ken’s story?”</p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong>"Yes, It started the day he died, and it all points back to that festival. We need to understand what happened then and why the curse has reactivated now.”</p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong> “We need to find a way to stop this. We can’t let it continue taking lives. What do we do next?”</p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong>(nodded)“We have to investigate more about Ken, the festival, and the art club. If we can find out what triggered the curse to reactivate, we might stand a chance of stopping it.”</p>
        <p><strong>Kaito:</strong>“Let’s split up and check the archives. There has to be more information we can dig up!”</p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong>"Agreed, The more we learn about Ken and the circumstances of the festival, the better our chances of breaking this curse.”</p>
        <p>As they began to search through the library's resources, Ema felt a flicker of hope. Together, they would uncover the truth and put an end to the cycle of fear that had gripped their school for too long.</p>
        <p><strong>Kaigo sensei:</strong>"You might find more about Ken in the previous art room"</p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong>"Previous art room?"</p>
        <p><strong>Kaigo sensei:</strong>(nodded) "It’s in the old building behind the school. It's closed off on the second floor."</p>
        <p><strong>Yamato:</strong>"But why is that building closed?"</p>
        <p><strong>Kaigo sensei:</strong>(expression darkened) "Years ago, a fire broke out in that building, and several students lost their lives in the incident. Since then, it's been off-limits."</p>
        <p>A tense silence filled the room as the weight of his words sank in. The possibility that the origin of the curse could be connected to a place so steeped in tragedy sent shivers down Ema's spine. </p>
        <p>Shin glanced at Ema</p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong>“We have to go there tomorrow. We can’t let fear hold us back. We need to find out what really happened.”</p>
        <p>Everyone agreed.</p>
