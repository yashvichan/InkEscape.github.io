        <h2>Scene: Emergency Meeting in the Art Club Room</h2>
        <p>Tomoya called everyone to the art club room at 3 o'clock for an urgent meeting, ensuring that no one else would be present. The atmosphere was tense as the group settled in, all aware of the weight of their situation.</p>
        <p><strong>Tomoya:</strong> “I checked every painting in the art club,But I didn’t find any that resemble the one from the article. This is really bad news.”</p>
     <p>Kaito leaned forward, concern etched on his face.</p>
        <p><strong>Kaito:</strong>“It’s been several days since we started our research, and we’re getting nowhere. At this rate, any day one of us could be next.”</p>
     <p><strong>Ema:</strong>(nodded, her anxiety palpable)“We have to find a way to break this curse before it claims another victim. We can’t let fear paralyze us.”</p>
     <p><strong>Shin:</strong>“We need to keep looking. There has to be something we’re missing, some clue that can lead us to the answer.”</p>
