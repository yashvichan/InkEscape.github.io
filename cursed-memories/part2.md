#(Scene: Emergency Meeting in the Art Club Room) 
Tomoya called everyone to the art club room at 3 o'clock for an urgent meeting, ensuring that no one 
else would be present. The atmosphere was tense as the group settled in, all aware of the weight of 
their situation. 
“I checked every painting in the art club,” Tomoya began, his voice grave. “But I didn’t find any that 
resemble the one from the article. This is really bad news.” 
Kaito leaned forward, concern etched on his face. “It’s been several days since we started our 
research, and we’re getting nowhere. At this rate, any day one of us could be next.” 
Ema nodded, her anxiety palpable. “We have to find a way to break this curse before it claims 
another victim. We can’t let fear paralyze us.” 
Shin interjected, “We need to keep looking. There has to be something we’re missing, some clue that 
can lead us to the answer.” 
Yamato spoke up, a furrow of concern on his brow. “Has anyone else noticed how Hiroshi’s behaviour 
has changed since the curse reactivated? He hasn’t been involved in any activities, and he avoids 
talking about it.” 
Kaito nodded in agreement. “Yeah, I haven’t seen him at any club activities either since that day.” 
Ema’s eyes widened in realization. “So, you guys are saying Hiroshi might be connected to this 
curse?” 
Tomoya chimed in, “Who knows? But we have to find out what’s really going on with Hiroshi. If he’s 
somehow connected to the curse or knows something more, we need to confront him.” 
Shin crossed his arms, deep in thought. “I agree. His sudden withdrawal from everything isn’t just a 
coincidence. It’s like he’s hiding something… or maybe he’s scared too.” 
Kaito frowned. “If he’s involved, we have to be careful. What if confronting him puts us in more 
danger?” 
Ema nodded, her voice hushed with concern. “We need a plan. We can’t go in blindly. We should try 
to find out more about Hiroshi first, maybe look into his recent activities or see if anyone else has 
noticed anything strange.” 
Shin stood, determination in his eyes. “Let’s split up again. Some of us can keep investigating Hiroshi 
quietly, while the others keep searching for that missing painting. If there’s any link between the two, 
we need to find it fast.” 
Everyone exchanged uneasy glances but nodded in agreement. The clock was ticking, and with each 
passing day, the curse’s next victim drew closer. 
As the group left the art club room, Shin felt the growing weight of responsibility pressing down on 
him. The mystery of the curse, Hiroshi’s strange behaviour, and the missing painting all seemed to 
intertwine into a dark web. There had to be a way to unravel it—but time was running out. 
#(Scene: An Unexpected Death) 
In the morning, the atmosphere in the classroom was tense as students whispered among 
themselves, wondering why Ren-sensei hadn’t arrived yet. It had been fifteen minutes since the class 
was supposed to start. 
Suddenly, Hikaru-sensei entered the room, a sombre expression on his face. “From today onwards, I 
will be your homeroom teacher,” he announced, his voice steady but with an underlying tremor. 
A girl named Naomi Yamaguchi raised her hand, concern evident in her eyes. “But, Sensei, where is 
Ren-sensei?” 
Hikaru’s face turned pale, and he began to tremble. “This morning, Ren-sensei and I were talking in 
the staff room when... suddenly, blood came out of his mouth. Before I could do anything, he 
collapsed and died right in front of my eyes.” 
Gasps echoed through the classroom as the weight of Hikaru’s words sank in. The reality of the curse 
hung heavily in the air, leaving everyone in stunned silence. 
#(Scene: The First Victim) 
Yamato and Ema quietly observed Hiroshi's behaviour as they walked alongside him, sharing worried 
glances. Meanwhile, Tomoya, Shin, and Kaito scoured the school in search of the mysterious painting. 
One day, as Hiroshi made his way home, he suddenly stopped and turned to face Yamato and Ema. 
“You both can come out. I already know about you two. Why are you following me for so many 
days?” 
Yamato hesitated, caught off guard. “It’s not like we were following you, we were just—” 
Ema cut him off, her tone serious. “I want to ask you about your sudden change in behaviour. Do you 
know anything about the curse or are you connected to it in any way? You need to share with us for 
everyone’s safety.” 
Hiroshi took a deep breath, weighing his words. “You guys… you’re overthinking everything….. What 
do you think when did this started curse?” 
Ema replied, “On April 16th, with the death of Aiko Yoshida.” 
Hiroshi shook his head. “No… it started on April 2nd.” 
Ema’s eyes widened in shock. “What?! What are you saying? Then who was its first victim?” 
Hiroshi’s expression darkened. “The first victim is Takashi… Mia Takashi, president of the student 
council.” 
Yamato blurted out, “Takashi? That means she’s your sister!” 
Hiroshi nodded, his gaze dropping. 
Ema’s voice softened. “Oh… I see. So, this is the reason for your sudden change in behaviour…” 
Just then, Ema’s phone rang, startling them. She looked at the screen and saw it was Shin. “It’s Shin,” 
she said, putting the call on speaker. 
“Ema, is Tomoya with you? Or do you see him?” Shin’s voice trembled with fear. 
“No, neither he is with us nor we have seen him. But what happened, Shin? He was supposed to be 
with you,” Ema replied, her heart racing. 
“He was with us, but suddenly he disappeared. We tried calling him multiple times, but he’s not 
picking up!” Shin’s voice echoed their growing dread. 
Hiroshi’s eyes widened. “What?! Guys, let’s hurry back to school. We’ll find him together!” 
#(Scene: The Unseen Terror) 
As they hurried toward the school, Ema glanced at Hiroshi and asked, “Why didn’t you tell us about 
this earlier?” 
Hiroshi sighed deeply. “I was... deeply affected by it. I couldn't bring myself to talk about it.” 
Ema’s expression softened. “I understand how it feels to lose someone close to you... Never mind…. I 
just hope Tomoya is alright.” 
As they approached the school gate, the atmosphere felt heavier. Just as Yamato stepped inside, a 
sudden thud echoed in front of them—a lifeless body fell to the ground. Ema screamed in horror, her 
voice piercing the air. 
“Is... is it Tomoya?” Yamato gasped, his face pale. 
Hearing Ema’s scream, Shin and Kaito rushed over, their hearts pounding. 
Other students who were still at school gathered around the horrifying scene, murmuring in shock 
and fear. 
As Yamato knelt down beside the body, his breath hitched. The blood-soaked clothes were 
unmistakable. 
“It’s... Tomoya,” he whispered, his voice trembling. 
Ema gasped in horror, taking a step back. “No, not him...” Her voice broke as she tried to process the 
sight of her friend lying there, lifeless. 
Shin and Kaito arrived, rushing over. The moment they saw Tomoya’s body, Shin’s knees gave way, 
and he collapsed beside him. “Tomoya...” His voice cracked with disbelief. 
Ema’s eyes filled with tears. “Why didn’t we find him sooner?” 
Yamato shook his head, anger and grief mixing in his expression. “This curse... it’s out of control. It’s 
not stopping.” 
Kaito, who had been silent, clenched his fists. “We were too late.” 
Hiroshi stood back, watching the scene unfold, his face pale but resolute. “The curse won’t stop 
unless we do something. Tomoya won’t be the last unless we figure out how to end this.” 
#(Scene: The Festival's Dark Secret) 
After the shock of the day's events, Ema felt an urgent need to seek answers. Determined, she made 
her way to the school library, her mind racing with the possibility that something crucial was still 
missing.  
"Kaigo-sensei," she called out as she hurried over to him, her voice tense with worry. "I need to tell 
you everything that's happened so far." 
She quickly recounted the strange occurrences, the reactivation of the curse, the mysterious deaths, 
and Tomoya's recent disappearance. Kaigo-sensei listened intently, his face growing more serious 
with each detail. When she finished, he was silent for a moment, thinking deeply. 
"I believe I may remember something important," Kaigo-sensei finally said, his voice low. "The 
curse... It started around the time of the school’s annual festival, 60 years ago. Every club was 
desperate to win first place that year. There was an intense rivalry—each club was pushing itself to 
the limit, determined to put on the best performance." 
Ema’s eyes widened. “So, you think it has something to do with that festival?” 
Kaigo-sensei nodded slowly. “It seems likely. Every club was involved, and tensions were high. But 
what exactly happened during that festival... I don’t recall. It was a long time ago.” 
“There must be some connection,” Ema said thoughtfully. “If the curse started around that festival, 
then something must have triggered it. What exactly caused this rivalry to turn into a curse?” 
Kaigo-sensei gestured toward the back of the library, where old school records were stored. "You 
might find answers in the school history. I recommend starting there. It contains information on 
every festival the school has ever held. Perhaps you'll find what you're looking for." 
Without wasting another second, Ema hurried toward the dusty shelves. She pulled out a thick, 
weathered book that chronicled the school’s past events, flipping through its pages with nervous 
anticipation. As she reached the section detailing the festival 60 years ago, a chilling realization 
washed over her. 
The pages described how a boy, a member of the art club, had worked tirelessly to complete a 
masterpiece for the festival, but due to jealousy and rivalry, it had been vandalized right before the 
event. The boy, heartbroken and humiliated, had passed away soon after. That tragic incident had 
marked the beginning of the curse. 
Ema froze as she read the final lines of the entry, her heart pounding. This was it—the origin of the 
curse. The boy's anguish had manifested into something far more dangerous, and it had been 
waiting, dormant, until now. 
With trembling hands, she closed the book and took a deep breath, trying to process what she had 
just learned. The words replayed in her mind: Ken Tanaka, a boy with dreams cut short by cruelty. 
The anguish he experienced had transformed into a curse that now plagued the school, claiming a 
life every fourteen days. 
Desperate to understand more about Ken, Ema glanced around the library for Kaigo-sensei. Spotting 
him near the reference section, she hurried over. "Kaigo-sensei," she said, her voice urgent. "I need 
to know more about Ken Tanaka. Is there another book or resource that can help me learn about 
him?" 
Kaigo-sensei regarded her with a concerned expression. "Yes, there is an art club history book that 
may provide more details about Ken's life and the events surrounding the festival. It should be on the 
shelf beside the one you just read." 
Ema nodded, her heart racing with anticipation. She quickly made her way to the shelf and found the 
book labelled "Art Club Archives." With a sense of urgency, she opened it and began to read through 
the pages. 
As she flipped through, Ema uncovered the story of Ken's dedication to art and the pride he took in 
his work. The pages detailed how he had poured his heart into creating a masterpiece for the 
upcoming annual festival, determined to prove himself and earn recognition from his peers. 
However, the tone shifted as she read about the relentless bullying he endured from classmates who 
sought to undermine him. 
Ema’s voice trembled as she read aloud, “Despite his talent, Ken faced mockery and ridicule. One 
fateful day, just before the festival, a group of bullies destroyed his painting, leaving him devastated. 
Overwhelmed by despair, Ken succumbed to his heart condition later that night. His unfulfilled 
dreams and pain seemed to echo through the walls of the school, leading to the curse that began 
that day.” 
The gravity of the situation settled heavily on Ema’s shoulders. She now understood how this curse 
had originated, fuelled by Ken’s anguish. 
“Ken…,” she whispered to herself, “we need to honour your memory and find a way to stop this 
curse.” 
After collecting her thoughts, Ema quickly pulled out her phone and dialled Shin's number. As she 
waited for him to pick up, her heart raced with anticipation. 
“Ema?” Shin’s voice crackled through the line. “What’s going on?” 
“Shin, you need to gather everyone and come to the library. I’ve discovered something important 
about the curse!” Ema urged, her voice filled with urgency. 
“Got it. We’ll be there as soon as we can!” Shin replied, and Ema hung up, feeling a mixture of hope 
and dread. 
Minutes later, Shin arrived with Yamato, Kaito, and Hiroshi, all looking anxious and ready for answers. 
Ema gestured for them to gather around the table where she had been studying. 
“Okay, everyone, listen up,” Ema began, taking a deep breath. “I found some crucial information in 
the school history books about the curse and its origin.” 
“What did you find?” Kaito asked, leaning forward with curiosity. 
Ema flipped open the pages of the book she had been reading and pointed to the passage. “This 
curse began with a boy named Ken Tanaka. He was an incredibly talented artist, and he dedicated 
himself to creating a masterpiece for our school’s annual festival. But just before the event, bullies 
destroyed his painting, which broke his spirit.” 
Yamato frowned. “That’s terrible. But how does that connect to the curse?” 
Ema continued, “After Ken’s painting was ruined, he was heartbroken. He died that night due to a 
heart condition, and his pain didn’t just vanish. It turned into a curse that has haunted this school 
ever since, claiming a life every fourteen days.” 
A hush fell over the group as the weight of Ema’s words sunk in. Hiroshi looked down, visibly shaken. 
“So, the deaths… they’re tied to Ken’s story?” 
“Yes,” Ema replied, her voice firm. “It started the day he died, and it all points back to that festival. 
We need to understand what happened then and why the curse has reactivated now.” 
Shin, now looking serious, said, “We need to find a way to stop this. We can’t let it continue taking 
lives. What do we do next?” 
Ema nodded, her determination growing stronger. “We have to investigate more about Ken, the 
festival, and the art club. If we can find out what triggered the curse to reactivate, we might stand a 
chance of stopping it.” 
Kaito glanced around the group, then said, “Let’s split up and check the archives. There has to be 
more information we can dig up!” 
“Agreed,” Ema said. “The more we learn about Ken and the circumstances of the festival, the better 
our chances of breaking this curse.” 
As they began to search through the library's resources, Ema felt a flicker of hope. Together, they 
would uncover the truth and put an end to the cycle of fear that had gripped their school for too 
long.

Kaigo sensei, observing their determination, spoke up. "You might find more about Ken in the 
previous art room," he suggested. The mention of the previous art room caught everyone off guard. 
"Previous art room?" Ema echoed, her curiosity piqued. 
Kaigo sensei nodded gravely. "It’s in the old building behind the school. It's closed off on the second 
f
 loor." 
Yamato frowned. "But why is that building closed?" 
Kaigo sensei's expression darkened. "Years ago, a fire broke out in that building, and several students 
lost their lives in the incident. Since then, it's been off-limits." 
A tense silence filled the room as the weight of his words sank in. The possibility that the origin of 
the curse could be connected to a place so steeped in tragedy sent shivers down Ema's spine. 
Shin glanced at Ema, determination flickering in his eyes. “We have to go there tomorrow. We can’t 
let fear hold us back. We need to find out what really happened.” 
Everyone agreed.
