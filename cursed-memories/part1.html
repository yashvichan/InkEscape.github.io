    <h1>Cursed Memories</h1>

    <div class="scene">
        <h2>Scene: Two teachers in the staff room</h2>
        <p>The dimly lit staff room was quiet, save for the ticking of a clock on the wall. Ren Tsubaki’s voice was low, almost a whisper.</p>
        <p><strong>Ren Tsubaki:</strong> "Time doesn’t change anything... Some things remain burned into our memory."</p>
        <p><strong>Hikaru Sugawara:</strong> (nodding) "No matter how much we try to bury them, some things refuse to stay forgotten."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="scene">
        <h2>Scene: A new transfer student arrives</h2>
        <p>The new student stood at the front of the room, feeling the weight of dozens of eyes on him.</p>
        <p><strong>Shin Kurosawa:</strong> "Good morning, everyone. I am Shin Kurosawa. I hope to get along with all of you."</p>
        <p>Their homeroom teacher, Ren Tsubaki, smiled.</p>
        <p><strong>Ren Tsubaki:</strong> "Everyone, give a warm welcome to your new classmate."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="scene">
        <h2>Scene: At lunchtime, Shin is surrounded by students</h2>
        <p>At lunch, a crowd gathered around Shin, bombarding him with questions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"What was your previous school like?"</li>
            <li>"Do you miss your old classmates?"</li>
            <li>"Why did you come to such a small town from a big city like Tokyo?"</li>
            <li>"What are your hobbies?"</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong> "I moved here because my dad got transferred. He left me with my grandparents. I don’t have any particular hobbies, but I miss some old classmates. I like this town because I want to be close to nature, which isn't possible in Tokyo."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="scene">
        <h2>Scene: A conversation with Ema</h2>
        <p>Later, after school, Shin spotted Ema alone and approached her.</p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong> "Why did you look so worried when I asked about the school? Is there something I should know?"</p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong> (hesitating) "Listen, there’s something you need to know... about this school. Every fourteen days, someone dies—a student, or a teacher."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="scene">
        <h2>Scene: The realization</h2>
        <p>Days passed, and the ominous weight of Ema's words lingered in Shin's mind. As the deadline approached, whispers in the hallways grew louder.</p>
        <p>Shin approached Hiroshi again.</p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong> "Do you believe Ema’s story? About the curse?"</p>
        <p><strong>Hiroshi:</strong> (somber) "She’s not wrong. I’ve heard the rumours... but I thought they were just stories to scare new students."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="scene">
        <h2>Scene: Discovering the Body</h2>
        <p>They followed the sound of a scream to a secluded corner of the schoolyard, where a small group of students had gathered, their faces pale and terrified.</p>
        <p>Shin pushed through the crowd, his stomach knotting as he spotted the source of the commotion.</p>
        <p><strong>Tomoya:</strong> (horrified) "It’s Hana Suzuki… from the calligraphy club."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="scene">
        <h2>Scene: Confronting the Librarian</h2>
        <p>Shin and Ema hurried to the library.</p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong> "We need to speak with Keigo-sensei. Maybe he knows something."</p>
        <p><strong>Keigo-sensei:</strong> (dark expression) "Missing pages, you say? I’ve heard of those… But I’m not sure you’ll like what you find."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="scene">
        <h2>Scene: The Curse’s Reach</h2>
        <p>Airi tried to escape, but as she and her family left town, a storm raged.</p>
        <p>The next morning, whispers spread through the school: Airi and her family had died in a tragic accident.</p>
        <p>"They say she was trying to escape the curse," one student muttered.</p>
        <p>"But no one can escape it… it doesn’t let you leave," another replied, shivering.</p>
