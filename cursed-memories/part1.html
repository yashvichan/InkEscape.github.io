    <div class="scene">
        <h2>Scene: Two teachers in the staff room</h2>
        <p>The dimly lit staff room was quiet, save for the ticking of a clock on the wall. Ren Tsubaki’s voice was low, almost a whisper.</p>
        <p><strong>Ren Tsubaki:</strong> "Time doesn’t change anything... Some things remain burned into our memory."</p>
        <p><strong>Hikaru Sugawara:</strong> (nodding) "No matter how much we try to bury them, some things refuse to stay forgotten."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="scene">
        <h2>Scene: A new transfer student arrives</h2>
        <p>The new student stood at the front of the room, feeling the weight of dozens of eyes on him.</p>
        <p><strong>Shin Kurosawa:</strong> "Good morning, everyone. I am Shin Kurosawa. I hope to get along with all of you."</p>
        <p>Their homeroom teacher, Ren Tsubaki, smiled.</p>
        <p><strong>Ren Tsubaki:</strong> "Everyone, give a warm welcome to your new classmate."</p>
        <p>Shin took his seat, noticing the curious glances and hushed whispers around him. Something in the air felt... off.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="scene">
        <h2>Scene: At lunchtime, Shin is surrounded by students asking questions.</h2>
        <p>At lunch, a crowd gathered around Shin, bombarding him with questions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"What was your previous school like?"</li>
            <li>"Do you miss your old classmates?"</li>
            <li>"Why did you come to such a small town from a big city like Tokyo?"</li>
            <li>"What are your hobbies?"</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong> "I moved here because my dad got transferred. He left me with my grandparents. I don’t have any particular hobbies, but I miss some old classmates. I like this town because I want to be close to nature, which isn't possible in Tokyo."</p>
        <p>Suddenly Shin saw a girl she was very pretty and confident her eyes were beautiful, there was something unsettling lurking behind them—fear, maybe... or something darker. Suddenly a voice distract shin from his thoughts</p>
        <p><strong>Hiroshi Takahashi:</strong>“ I am Hiroshi Takahashi male officer of our class and that girl is Ema Kawasaki female officer of our class”</p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong>(Hesitate)(voice barely above a whisper)'Since I arrived, I've noticed something... Everyone seems... afraid. What’s going on?'</p>
        <p>His words hung in the air like a cold breath on a winter's night. The chatter stopped. Hiroshi's smile faltered, and Ema’s gaze shifted uneasily.</p>
        <p>Hiroshi’s smile returned, but it didn’t quite reach his eyes.</p>
        <p><strong>Hiroshi:</strong>'You’re just overthinking. It’s the pressure of the upcoming exams... Would you like a tour of the school now ?'</p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong>(excited)"Of course, why not?"</p>
        <p>Everyone appeared to relax. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="scene">
        <h2>Scene: The tour of the school</h2>
        <p>As they walked through the school, Shin couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong.</p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong>"Why does everyone act like they’re hiding something?"</p>
        <p>Hiroshi chuckled, but Ema's expression darkened.</p>
        <p><strong>Hiroshi:</strong>"You’ll understand soon enough, Shin. Just... be careful."</p>
        <p>Unsettled, Shin felt a surge of determination. </p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong>“By the way, are you guys’ part of any clubs?” </p>
        <p>Shin try to steer the conversation toward something less tense.</p>
        <p>Hiroshi:<strong></strong>(shrugged)“I’m in the basketball club. It helps take my mind off things.” </p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong>“I’m in the art club,We’re working on a mural for the school.You should join us, Shin!”</p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong>(Hesitate)“Art? I’m not very good at it…”</p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong>“You don’t have to be a master,It’s more about expressing yourself. Plus, it’s a great way to meet new people.”</p>
        <p><strong>Yamato and Tomoya chimed in:</strong> “Yeah! We’re also in the art club. Join us, Shin! It’s going to be fun!” </p>
        <p>Shin felt a rush of camaraderie.</p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong>“Okay, I’m in. Count me in for the art club!”</p>
        <p>Ema smiled, her eyes sparkling with relief.</p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong>“Great! I’ll make sure to show you the ropes.”</p>
    </div>    

    <div class="scene">
        <h2>Scene: A conversation with Ema</h2>
        <p>Later, after school, Shin spotted Ema alone and approached her.</p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong> "Why did you look so worried when I asked about the school? Is there something I should know?"</p>
        <p>Ema eyes darting around as if afraid of being overheard.</p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong> (hesitating) "Listen, there’s something you need to know... about this school. Every fourteen days, someone dies—a student, or a teacher."</p>
        <p>Shin’s heart raced.</p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong>"What do you mean? Why?"</p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong>(took a deep breath)"It's a curse. Fifty-eight years ago, a batch of students did something to stop it, but now it’s been reactivated... and no one knows how."</p>
        <p>Shin's mind raced with questions.</p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong>"How do we stop it?"</p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong>(shook her head)"We don’t know. We just have to hope it doesn’t take anyone we care about.(paused,look away for a moment before adding quietly)" "Two students have already died. One was Aiko Yoshida from our class... and the other was Sota Takahashi from the basketball club."</p>
        <p>The weight of her words hit Shin hard. His chest tightened as he realized the severity of the situation.</p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong>( repeated, his voice barely audible.)"Two deaths already..."</p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong>(nodded)"And if we don’t figure out what's causing this,more will follow."</p>        
    </div>

    <div class="scene">
        <h2>Scene: The realization</h2>
        <p>Days passed, and the ominous weight of Ema's words lingered in Shin's mind. As the deadline approached, whispers in the hallways grew louder.</p>
        <p>Shin began to notice the strange behaviour of his classmates—glances exchanged, hushed conversations, and the ever-present fear in their eyes. </p>
        <p>Shin approached Hiroshi again.</p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong> "Do you believe Ema’s story? About the curse?"</p>
        <p><strong>Hiroshi:</strong> (somber) "She’s not wrong. I’ve heard the rumours... but I thought they were just stories to scare new students."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="scene">
        <h2>Scene: Planning the investigation</h2>
        <p>Determined to uncover the truth, Shin approached his classmates Yamato Sakamoto and Tomoya Ueda the next day.</p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong> “We need to figure out what’s happening in this school, can you help me?”</p>
        <p><strong>Yamato:</strong>(nodded)“I’ve been feeling the tension in the air, too. We should look into the school’s history.”</p>
        <p>Tomoya had a knack for research</p>
        <p><strong>Tomoya:</strong>“Let’s meet at the library after school. I can check the old records for anything unusual.”</p>
    </div> 

    <div class="scene">
        <h2>Scene:  At the library</h2>
        <p>As they entered the dimly lit library, a musty smell greeted them. The shelves towered over them, filled with dusty old books and records. The trio made their way to the history section, where the librarian guided them to archives about the school.</p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong>(flipping through a dusty yearbook)“Look for anything about past incidents or students,There has to be something here.”</p>
        <p>Hours passed as they combed through old newspapers and records. They stumbled upon a faded article that caught their attention: </p>
        <p><strong>“Tragedy Strikes: Mysterious Deaths in Hoshino High” </strong></p>
        <p>The article detailed a series of deaths that occurred every 14 days in the school, with students and teachers mysteriously vanishing or dying under strange circumstances. The dates lined up eerily with the current events.</p>
        <p>Shin felt a chill run down his spine.</p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong> “This is it,This is what they were afraid of. The curse isn’t just a rumour; it’s real!”</p>
        <p>Yamato leaned closer to the article, his brows furrowing.</p>
        <p>Yamato:<strong>“But why did it stop for so long? And what reactivated it?”</strong></p>
        <p>Tomoya, flipping through the book, noticed something strange.</p>
        <p><strong>Tomoya:</strong>(pointing to the torn edges) “It looks like someone ripped out a few pages. Maybe someone doesn’t want the curse to be stopped.”</p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong>(paled)“But why… why would anyone want that? It’ll kill everyone... We have to find those missing pages, no matter what.”</p>
    </div>

    <div class="scene">
        <h2>Scene: Leaving the Library</h2>
        <p>As they stepped out of the dimly lit library, Shin spotted Ema just ahead, exiting after her conversation with the librarian. He quickened his pace to catch up with her.</p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong>“Hey, Ema!”</p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong>(surprised)“Oh, hey, Shin! Did you find anything interesting?”</p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong>“Yeah, we discovered some articles about the mysterious deaths here,But I wanted to ask you about the librarian. What did you talk about?”</p>
        <p>Ema glanced around, ensuring no one was eavesdropping.</p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong>“Mr. Keigo Haruto is the oldest person in the school. He studied here, became a teacher, and then transitioned to being the librarian when he got too old to teach. It’s quite possible he knows something about the curse.” </p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong> “But you don’t sound hopeful…”</p>
        <p>Ema sighed, running a hand through her hair.</p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong> “The thing is, it seems like his memory of that particular year has vanished. He might have known something once, but now… it’s like he’s forgotten it entirely.”</p>
        <p><strong>Tomoya:</strong>“That’s frustrating. If he holds the key to understanding the curse, how do we get him to remember?”</p>
        <p><strong>Yamato:</strong>(crossed his arms thoughtfully) “Maybe we can ask him about his experiences more directly? If we approach him carefully, he might recall something.”</p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong>(nodded)“We need to try. If we can unlock the memories of that year, we might find a way to stop this curse.(paused for a moment) We should split up,Some of us can talk to the Keigo-sensei, while the rest can look for more records or ask around town about past incidents.”</p>
        <p><strong>Yamato:</strong>“Agreed,The more information we gather, the better.”</p>
        <p>But before anyone could respond, a piercing scream echoed through the hallways, slicing through the air like a knife. The group exchanged alarmed glances, adrenaline surging through them.</p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong>(voice trembling)“What was that?” </p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong>“Let’s go check it out!”</p>
        <p>they rushed down the corridor, hearts pounding.</p>
    </div>    

    <div class="scene">
        <h2>Scene: Discovering the Body</h2>
        <p>They followed the sound of a scream to a secluded corner of the schoolyard, where a small group of students had gathered, their faces pale and terrified.</p>
        <p>Shin pushed through the crowd, his stomach knotting as he spotted the source of the commotion.Lying motionless on the ground was the body of a girl, her eyes wide open in shock.</p>
        <p>A heavy silence enveloped them, broken only by the sound of muffled sobs.</p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong>(whispered)“No... not again”</p>
        <p><strong>Tomoya:</strong> (horrified) "It’s Hana Suzuki… from the calligraphy club."</p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong>(voice trembling)“This... this is real,The curse isn’t just a story. It’s taken Hana.”</p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong>(eyes filled with tears)“We need to figure out how to stop this before it claims anyone else”</p>
        <p><strong>Tomoya:</strong>“But how? If we’re not safe here...”</p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong>“We have to confront Keigo-sensei,He might hold the key to understanding why this is happening.”</p>
    </div>

    <div class="scene">
        <h2>Scene: Confronting the Librarian</h2>
        <p>Shin and Ema hurried to the Keigo-sensei, their minds racing with questions about the missing pages they had uncovered.</p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong> "We need to speak with Keigo-sensei. Maybe he knows something."</p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong>(nodded)"Let’s hope he can help."</p>
        <p>They entered the quiet, dim library, the atmosphere thick with unease. Keigo-sensei glanced up from his desk as they approached. His eyes were tired but curious.</p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong>“We were wondering about some missing pages,In the old articles about the deaths here. We think they might hold important information about the curse.”</p>        
        <p><strong>Keigo-sensei:</strong> (dark expression) "Missing pages, you say? I’ve heard of those… But I’m not sure you’ll like what you find."</p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong>“Please, we need to know,If there’s anything you can give us, it could help us stop the curse.”</p>
        <p>Keigo-sensei hesitated before standing slowly, motioning for them to follow.</p>
        <p><strong>Keigo-sensei:</strong> “Come with me.”</p>
        <p>He led them to a far corner of the library, where the shelves were thick with dust, and the air felt colder. The smell of aged paper filled the space as he began rummaging through old, faded files. After a tense few minutes of silence, he finally pulled out a fragile, yellowed page.</p>
        <p>Keigo-sensei handing the paper to Ema</p>
        <p><strong>Keigo-sensei:</strong>“This... this is what you’re looking for”</p>
        <p>Ema’s eyes widened in shock as she gazed at the page. Her hands shook slightly as she held it up for Shin to see.</p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong>“But... this is a picture of a painting"</p>
        <p>Suddenly, a voice came from behind them, startling both Shin and Ema.They spun around and saw a boy and a girl standing in the shadows, just to their right. The boy stepped forward, his expression thoughtful yet serious, while the girl stood quietly beside him, her gaze fixed on the yellowed page.</p>
        <p><strong>boy:</strong>“It’s quite possible that this painting is connected to the curse”</p>
        <P>Shin squinted, trying to recall where he had seen them before.</P>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong> “Wait… you’re in our class, right?”</p>
        <p><strong>girl:</strong>(nodded)“Yes, we are. I’m Airi Sato, and this is Kaito Nakamura”</p>
        <p><strong>Kaito:</strong>“Please, let me join your investigation. I want to stop this curse desperately.”</p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong>(nodded)“Why not? We could use the help. We’ll all work together as a team.”</p>
        <p>Shin turned to Airi, his expression softening.</p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong> “What about you, Airi? Will you join us?”</p>
        <p><strong>Airi:</strong>(hesitate) “No... I’m busy with my work in the literature club. Besides…(pause for a second) Never mind.”</p>
        <p>Without another word, Airi turned and left, leaving Shin and the others standing in awkward silence as her footsteps echoed down the hallway. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="scene">
        <h2>Scene: The Curse’s Reach</h2>
        <p>It was raining heavily when Airi finally reached her home. The streets were dark, illuminated only by the occasional flicker of lightning in the distance. As she stepped inside, she saw her parents had already packed her luggage. Without a word, she slipped into the backseat of the car, too shaken to say anything. Her father glanced at her in the rearview mirror, gave a comforting nod, and started driving.</p>
        <p>The rain beat down relentlessly as they drove through the nearly empty streets, heading out of the town. The tension in the air was thick, and Airi stared out of the window, watching the rain blur the scenery as they passed.</p>
        <p>Just as they were about to cross the town’s boundary, a deafening thunderclap filled the air.Lightning struck with an explosive force, hitting the car. The vehicle veered off the road, skidding uncontrollably before crashing into a nearby tree. The car crumpled on impact, and within moments, it was eerily silent.</p>
        <p>By morning, the news spread like wildfire throughout the school: Airi and her family had died in a tragic accident. Whispers filled the hallways, rumours swirling with a chilling intensity. </p>
        <p>"They say she was trying to escape the curse," one student muttered.</p>
        <p>"But no one can escape it… it doesn’t let you leave," another replied, shivering.</p>
