##Cursed Memories
#(Scene: Two teachers in the staff room, Ren Tsubaki and Hikaru Sugawara, are talking.) 
The dimly lit staff room was quiet, save for the ticking of a clock on the wall. Ren Tsubaki’s voice was 
low, almost a whisper. 
"Time doesn’t change anything... Some things remain burned into our memory." 
Hikaru Sugawara nodded, their voice heavy. 
"No matter how much we try to bury them, some things refuse to stay forgotten.” 
#(Scene: A new transfer student arrives in class.) 
The new student stood at the front of the room, feeling the weight of dozens of eyes on him. 
"Good morning, everyone. I am Shin Kurosawa. I hope to get along with all of you." 
Their homeroom teacher, Ren Tsubaki, smiled. 
"Everyone, give a warm welcome to your new classmate." 
Shin took his seat, noticing the curious glances and hushed whispers around him. Something in the 
air felt... off. 
#(Scene: At lunchtime, Shin is surrounded by students asking questions.) 
At lunch, a crowd gathered around Shin, bombarding him with questions. 
"What was your previous school like?" 
"Do you miss your old classmates?" 
"Why did you come to such a small town from a big city like Tokyo?" 
"What are your hobbies?" 
Shin replied, "I moved here because my dad got transferred. He left me with my grandparents. I 
don’t have any particular hobbies, but I miss some old classmates. I like this town because I want to 
be close to nature, which isn't possible in Tokyo." 
Suddenly Shin saw a girl she was very pretty and confident her eyes were beautiful, there was 
something unsettling lurking behind them—fear, maybe... or something darker. Suddenly a boy said 
“ I am Hiroshi Takahashi male officer of our class and that girl is Ema Kawasaki female officer of our 
class”  
Shin hesitated, his voice barely above a whisper. 'Since I arrived, I've noticed something... Everyone 
seems... afraid. What’s going on?' 
His words hung in the air like a cold breath on a winter's night. The chatter stopped. Hiroshi's smile 
faltered, and Ema’s gaze shifted uneasily. 
Hiroshi’s smile returned, but it didn’t quite reach his eyes. 'You’re just overthinking. It’s the pressure 
of the upcoming exams... Would you like a tour of the school now ? 
Shin seemed excited and replied, "Of course, why not?" 
Everyone appeared to relax. 
#(Scene: The tour of the school.) 
As they walked through the school, Shin couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong. 
"Why does everyone act like they’re hiding something?" he asked. 
Hiroshi chuckled, but Ema's expression darkened. 
"You’ll understand soon enough, Shin. Just... be careful." 
Unsettled, Shin felt a surge of determination. “By the way, are you guys’ part of any clubs?” he asked, 
trying to steer the conversation toward something less tense. 
Hiroshi shrugged. “I’m in the basketball club. It helps take my mind off things.” 
“I’m in the art club,” Ema said, her eyes lighting up slightly. “We’re working on a mural for the school. 
You should join us, Shin!” 
Shin hesitated. “Art? I’m not very good at it…” 
“You don’t have to be a master,” Ema encouraged. “It’s more about expressing yourself. Plus, it’s a 
great way to meet new people.” 
Yamato and Tomoya chimed in, “Yeah! We’re also in the art club. Join us, Shin! It’s going to be fun!” 
Shin felt a rush of camaraderie. “Okay, I’m in. Count me in for the art club!” 
Ema smiled, her eyes sparkling with relief. “Great! I’ll make sure to show you the ropes.” 
#(Scene: A conversation with Ema.) 
Later, after school, Shin spotted Ema alone and approached her. 
"Why did you look so worried when I asked about the school? Is there something I should know?" 
She hesitated, her eyes darting around as if afraid of being overheard. 
"Listen, there’s something you need to know... about this school. Every fourteen days, someone 
dies—a student, or a teacher." 
Shin’s heart raced. 
"What do you mean? Why?" 
Ema took a deep breath. 
"It's a curse. Fifty-eight years ago, a batch of students did something to stop it, but now it’s been 
reactivated... and no one knows how." 
Shin's mind raced with questions. 
"How do we stop it?" 
Ema shook her head, her expression grave. 
"We don’t know. We just have to hope it doesn’t take anyone we care about." 
She paused, looking away for a moment before adding quietly, "Two students have already died. One 
was Aiko Yoshida from our class... and the other was Sota Takahashi from the basketball club." 
The weight of her words hit Shin hard. His chest tightened as he realized the severity of the situation. 
"Two deaths already..." he repeated, his voice barely audible. 
Ema nodded, her eyes filled with fear and sadness. "And if we don’t figure out what's causing this, 
more will follow." 
#(Scene: The realization.) 
Days passed, and the ominous weight of Ema's words lingered in Shin's mind. As the deadline 
approached, whispers in the hallways grew louder. 
Shin began to notice the strange behaviour of his classmates—glances exchanged, hushed 
conversations, and the ever-present fear in their eyes. 
He approached Hiroshi again. 
"Do you believe Ema’s story? About the curse?" 
Hiroshi’s smile faded, replaced by a sombre expression. 
"She’s not wrong. I’ve heard the rumours... but I thought they were just stories to scare new 
students." 
#(Scene: Planning the investigation) 
Determined to uncover the truth, Shin approached his classmates Yamato Sakamoto and Tomoya 
Ueda the next day. “We need to figure out what’s happening in this school,” he said, his voice steady 
but urgent. “Can you help me?” 
Yamato, with his sharp eyes and quick wit, nodded. “I’ve been feeling the tension in the air, too. We 
should look into the school’s history.” 
Tomoya, who had a knack for research, added, “Let’s meet at the library after school. I can check the 
old records for anything unusual.” 
#(Scene: At the library)  
As they entered the dimly lit library, a musty smell greeted them. The shelves towered over them, 
f
 illed with dusty old books and records. The trio made their way to the history section, where the 
librarian guided them to archives about the school. 
“Look for anything about past incidents or students,” Shin suggested, flipping through a dusty 
yearbook. “There has to be something here.” 
Hours passed as they combed through old newspapers and records. They stumbled upon a faded 
article that caught their attention: 
“Tragedy Strikes: Mysterious Deaths in Hoshino High” 
The article detailed a series of deaths that occurred every 14 days in the school, with students and 
teachers mysteriously vanishing or dying under strange circumstances. The dates lined up eerily with 
the current events. 
Shin felt a chill run down his spine. “This is it,” he whispered. “This is what they were afraid of. The 
curse isn’t just a rumour; it’s real!” 
Yamato leaned closer to the article, his brows furrowing. “But why did it stop for so long? And what 
reactivated it?” 
Tomoya, flipping through the book, noticed something strange. "Look at this!" he exclaimed, pointing 
to the torn edges. “It looks like someone ripped out a few pages. Maybe someone doesn’t want the 
curse to be stopped.” 
Shin’s face paled as a sense of dread settled over him. “But why… why would anyone want that? It’ll 
kill everyone... We have to find those missing pages, no matter what.”  
#(Scene: Leaving the Library) 
As they stepped out of the dimly lit library, Shin spotted Ema just ahead, exiting after her 
conversation with the librarian. He quickened his pace to catch up with her. 
“Hey, Ema!” Shin called out, his curiosity piqued. 
Ema turned, her expression a mix of surprise and relief. “Oh, hey, Shin! Did you find anything 
interesting?” 
“Yeah, we discovered some articles about the mysterious deaths here,” Shin replied, his voice low. 
“But I wanted to ask you about the librarian. What did you talk about?” 
Ema glanced around, ensuring no one was eavesdropping. “Mr. Keigo Haruto is the oldest person in 
the school. He studied here, became a teacher, and then transitioned to being the librarian when he 
got too old to teach. It’s quite possible he knows something about the curse.” 
Shin frowned. “But you don’t sound hopeful…” 
Ema sighed, running a hand through her hair. “The thing is, it seems like his memory of that 
particular year has vanished. He might have known something once, but now… it’s like he’s forgotten 
it entirely.” 
Tomoya chimed in, “That’s frustrating. If he holds the key to understanding the curse, how do we get 
him to remember?” 
Yamato crossed his arms thoughtfully. “Maybe we can ask him about his experiences more directly? 
If we approach him carefully, he might recall something.” 
Shin nodded, determination shining in his eyes. “We need to try. If we can unlock the memories of 
that year, we might find a way to stop this curse.” 
“We should split up,” Shin suggested, his brow furrowed with determination. “Some of us can talk to 
the Keigo-sensei, while the rest can look for more records or ask around town about past incidents.” 
“Agreed,” Yamato said. “The more information we gather, the better.” 
But before anyone could respond, a piercing scream echoed through the hallways, slicing through 
the air like a knife. The group exchanged alarmed glances, adrenaline surging through them. 
“What was that?” Ema exclaimed, her voice trembling. 
“Let’s go check it out!” Shin urged, leading the way as they rushed down the corridor, hearts 
pounding. 
#(Scene: Discovering the Body) 
They followed the sound to a secluded corner of the schoolyard, where a small group of students 
had gathered, their faces pale and terrified. 
Shin pushed through the crowd, his stomach knotting as he spotted the source of the commotion. 
Lying motionless on the ground was the body of a girl, her eyes wide open in shock. 
A heavy silence enveloped them, broken only by the sound of muffled sobs. 
“No... not again,” Ema whispered, her voice choked with disbelief. 
Tomoya knelt beside the body, a horrified expression on his face. “It’s Hana Suzuki… from the 
calligraphy club.” 
“This... this is real,” Shin said, voice trembling. “The curse isn’t just a story. It’s taken Hana.” 
Ema’s eyes filled with tears. “We need to figure out how to stop this before it claims anyone else,” 
she said, determination flashing in her gaze. 
“But how?” Tomoya asked, looking around at the stunned students. “If we’re not safe here...” 
“We have to confront Keigo-sensei,” Shin insisted, his voice steadying. “He might hold the key to 
understanding why this is happening.” 
#(Scene: Confronting the Librarian) 
Shin and Ema hurried to the Keigo-sensei, their minds racing with questions about the missing pages 
they had uncovered. 
"We need to speak with Keigo-sensei. Maybe he knows something," Shin suggested, urgency in his 
voice. 
Ema nodded, still shaken. "Let’s hope he can help." 
They entered the quiet, dim library, the atmosphere thick with unease. Keigo-sensei glanced up from 
his desk as they approached. His eyes were tired but curious. 
“We were wondering about some missing pages,” Shin began cautiously. “In the old articles about 
the deaths here. We think they might hold important information about the curse.” 
Keigo-sensei expression darkened, his hands twitching slightly. “Missing pages, you say? I’ve heard of 
those,” he muttered, his voice barely above a whisper. “But I’m not sure you’ll like what you find.” 
“Please, we need to know,” Ema pressed, leaning forward. “If there’s anything you can give us, it 
could help us stop the curse.” 
Keigo-sensei hesitated before standing slowly, motioning for them to follow. “Come with me.” 
He led them to a far corner of the library, where the shelves were thick with dust, and the air felt 
colder. The smell of aged paper filled the space as he began rummaging through old, faded files. 
After a tense few minutes of silence, he finally pulled out a fragile, yellowed page. 
“This... this is what you’re looking for,” he said gravely, handing the paper to Ema. 
Ema’s eyes widened in shock as she gazed at the page. Her hands shook slightly as she held it up for 
Shin to see. 
“But... this is a picture of a painting,” she whispered, her voice filled with disbelief. 
Suddenly, a voice came from behind them, startling both Shin and Ema. 
“It’s quite possible that this painting is connected to the curse,” the voice said calmly, cutting through 
the tense silence. 
They spun around and saw a boy and a girl standing in the shadows, just to their right. The boy 
stepped forward, his expression thoughtful yet serious, while the girl stood quietly beside him, her 
gaze fixed on the yellowed page. 
Shin squinted, trying to recall where he had seen them before. “Wait… you’re in our class, right?” 
The girl nodded slightly, still looking at the painting. “Yes, we are. I’m Airi Sato, and this is Kaito 
Nakamura,” she said, gesturing to the boy beside her. 
Kaito spoke in a humble voice, “Please, let me join your investigation. I want to stop this curse 
desperately.” 
Shin looked at him and gave a small nod. “Why not? We could use the help. We’ll all work together 
as a team.” 
Then, he turned to Airi, his expression softening. “What about you, Airi? Will you join us?” 
Airi hesitated, avoiding his gaze. “No... I’m busy with my work in the literature club. Besides…” She 
paused, her voice trailing off. “Never mind.” 
Without another word, Airi turned and left, leaving Shin and the others standing in awkward silence 
as her footsteps echoed down the hallway. 
#(Scene: The Curse’s Reach) 
It was raining heavily when Airi finally reached her home. The streets were dark, illuminated only by 
the occasional flicker of lightning in the distance. As she stepped inside, she saw her parents had 
already packed her luggage. Without a word, she slipped into the backseat of the car, too shaken to 
say anything. Her father glanced at her in the rearview mirror, gave a comforting nod, and started 
driving. 
The rain beat down relentlessly as they drove through the nearly empty streets, heading out of the 
town. The tension in the air was thick, and Airi stared out of the window, watching the rain blur the 
scenery as they passed. 
Just as they were about to cross the town’s boundary, a deafening thunderclap filled the air. 
Lightning struck with an explosive force, hitting the car. The vehicle veered off the road, skidding 
uncontrollably before crashing into a nearby tree. The car crumpled on impact, and within moments, 
it was eerily silent. 
By morning, the news spread like wildfire throughout the school: Airi and her family had died in a 
tragic accident. Whispers filled the hallways, rumours swirling with a chilling intensity. 
“They say she was trying to escape the curse,” one student muttered. 
“But no one can escape it… it doesn’t let you leave,” another replied, shivering.
