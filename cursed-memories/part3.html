        <h2>Scene: The Day of Reckoning</h2>
        <p>The next morning, the group gathered at the school entrance, their hearts pounding with anticipation and fear.</p>
        <p><strong>Kaito:</strong> "But we need to be careful. Who knows what might be in there?"</p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong>(heart race)"We have to do this. For everyone who has suffered because of this curse."</p>
        <p>The group exchanged determined looks, ready to face whatever lay ahead. As they made their way toward the old building, the air grew colder, and an unsettling silence enveloped them.</p>
        <p>When they reached the back of the school, the old building loomed before them, its windows dark and its structure worn. A chill crept up Emaâ€™s spine as she pushed open the creaking door, revealing a darkened hallway that felt heavy with unspoken memories.</p>
        <p>Yamato leading the way as they stepped inside. The air was stale, and the scent of ash lingered, reminding them of the tragedy that had unfolded here.</p>
        <p><strong>Yamato:</strong>"Stay close"</p>
