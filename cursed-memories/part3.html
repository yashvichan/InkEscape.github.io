        <h2>Scene: The Day of Reckoning</h2>
        <p>The next morning, the group gathered at the school entrance, their hearts pounding with anticipation and fear.</p>
        <p><strong>Kaito:</strong> "But we need to be careful. Who knows what might be in there?"</p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong>(heart race)"We have to do this. For everyone who has suffered because of this curse."</p>
        <p>The group exchanged determined looks, ready to face whatever lay ahead. As they made their way toward the old building, the air grew colder, and an unsettling silence enveloped them.</p>
        <p>When they reached the back of the school, the old building loomed before them, its windows dark and its structure worn. A chill crept up Ema’s spine as she pushed open the creaking door, revealing a darkened hallway that felt heavy with unspoken memories.</p>
        <p>Yamato leading the way as they stepped inside. The air was stale, and the scent of ash lingered, reminding them of the tragedy that had unfolded here.</p>
        <p><strong>Yamato:</strong>"Stay close"</p>
        <p>As they climbed the staircase to the second floor, every creak of the old wood echoed like a warning. Ema could feel the tension building in the group. They reached the door to the previous art room, its surface marked with soot and age.</p>
        <p>With a deep breath, Ema pushed the door open. Inside, they found a dusty room filled with old easels and half-finished paintings. But one painting, covered with a thick layer of dust, drew Ema's attention.</p>
        <p>"Look at this," she said, brushing off the dust to reveal a hauntingly beautiful image of a boy sitting beneath a cherry blossom tree, a gentle smile on his face. "It’s Ken."</p>
        <p>Suddenly, a gust of wind swept through the room, extinguishing their flashlights. Panic surged within Ema as the atmosphere shifted. Whispers filled the air, growing louder, echoing Ken’s name.</p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong>(shouted)"Get back! We need to leave now!" </p>
        <p>Shin step in front of Ema protectively as shadows began to swirl around them.</p>
        <p>Ema felt a mixture of fear and determination, torn between wanting to understand and the very real danger surrounding them.</p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong>"No! I need to know!"</p>
        <p>As the shadows thickened, Shin grabbed her hand, his grip firm and reassuring.</p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong>"Ema, listen to me! We can’t stay here. It’s too dangerous!"</p>
        <p>Before she could respond, the room erupted with a blinding light, and the shadows shrieked, retreating into the corners. Shin urged her to move, and together they stumbled into the hallway, gasping for breath.</p>
        <p>But just as they reached the doorway, Ema felt the darkness pulling at her, desperate to claim her. In that moment, she realized how close they were to the edge of something horrific.</p>
        <p>"Stay with me, Ema!" Shin shouted, his voice cutting through the chaos as he pulled her closer, shielding her from the swirling shadows.</p>
        <p>With their hearts pounding, they burst into the open air outside the building, but the feeling of being pursued lingered in the air. Ema looked back, a sense of dread settling in her stomach. They had awakened something dangerous, and it was far from over.</p>        
    </div>

    <div class="scene">
        <h2>Scene: The Hallway of Foreboding</h2>
        <p>Ema spent the next few days at home, the shadows of the old building haunting her thoughts. The unsettling whispers and swirling darkness replayed in her mind, making her feel vulnerable. She often found herself staring out the window, hoping for a sign of clarity but only feeling more lost.</p>
        <p>Shin had been a constant presence, texting her daily to check on her well-being. Each message was filled with concern and updates on their research, but despite their efforts, they hadn’t uncovered anything new about the curse or Ken's tragic past.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, at school, the atmosphere was heavy with anxiety as exam results were released. Hiroshi stood next to Shin, fidgeting as students buzzed with nervous energy. Hiroshi glancing at Shin.</p>
        <p><strong>Hiroshi:</strong>“What are you thinking about doing after graduation?”</p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong>“I haven’t decided yet, What about you?”</p>
        <p>Shin mind still on Ema and the mystery they were trying to unravel.</p>
        <p>Hiroshi opened his mouth to respond but suddenly received a message that made his heart race. It was from Rika Tachibana, his best friend. Without a word, he excused himself and hurried toward the stairs, his mind racing.</p>
        <p>Upon reaching the landing, he spotted Rika standing nervously, her brow furrowed with concern.</p>
        <p><strong>Hiroshi:</strong>(worried) “Why did you call me in such a hurry? Are you alright?”</p>
        <p>Rika looked scared, her eyes darting around.</p>
        <p><strong>Rika:</strong>"I don’t know, Hiroshi. I feel something really bad is going to happen."</p>
        <p><strong>Hiroshi:</strong>"It's probably just exam stress. Don’t think about it much ."</p>
        <p>Just then, a cold wind swept through the hallway, making them shiver. The lights flickered, and an unsettling silence fell.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, dark shadows began to gather around them. Rika gasped, her heart racing.</p>
        <p><strong>Rika:</strong> "We need to get out of here!"</p>
        <p>Before they could escape, the shadows lunged at them, wrapping around Rika first. "Hiroshi!" she screamed, her eyes wide with fear. </p>
        <p>Hiroshi reached for her, but the darkness pulled him in too. "No! Rika!" he shouted, helpless against the force surrounding them. </p>
        <p>In an instant, the shadows engulfed them both, leaving behind an eerie silence in the hallway.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="scene">
        <h2>Scene: The Discovery</h2>
        <p>The next day, the school was buzzing with rumours. Whispers of strange events and missing students spread quickly. Ema, still recovering at home, had no idea what had happened to Hiroshi and Rika.</p>
        <p>Shin, Yamato, and Kaito were on their way to meet Ema after school to update her on their research, though they still hadn’t found any solid answers. As they walked through the now eerily quiet hallways, they noticed something strange—a large crowd had gathered near the stairwell.</p>
        <p>"What’s going on?" Yamato muttered, pushing through the crowd, his curiosity getting the better of him.</p>
        <p>When they reached the front, Shin’s blood ran cold. There, at the bottom of the stairs, lay Hiroshi and Rika, motionless, their faces frozen in terror. The sight sent a wave of dread crashing over them.</p>
        <p>Naomi gasped, backing away. "No... not them."</p>
        <p>Yamato stood frozen, unable to process what he was seeing. "We have to tell Ema."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="scene">
        <h2>Scene: Breaking the News</h2>
        <p>That evening, Shin, Yamato, and Kaito arrived at Ema’s house, their faces grim. Ema, sensing something was wrong, opened the door slowly.</p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong>"What's going on?"</p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong>(hesitate)"Ema... Hiroshi and Rika... they’re gone." </p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong>(face paled)"What... what do you mean?"</p>
        <p><strong>Kaito:</strong>"They died. We think the curse claimed them"</p>
        <p>Ema’s mind raced, and her heart sank. She had known the curse was dangerous, but now two of her friends were gone. "It’s getting worse," she whispered, tears welling up in her eyes.</p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong>(step closer to Ema) "We need to stop this. We have to figure out how the curse was reawakened." </p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong>(wiped her tears and nodded) "We will. We can’t let anyone else die.We have to go in that room again, We can’t afford to lose more of our friends. Hiroshi and Rika are already gone. We can’t let their deaths be in vain."</p>
        <p><strong>Yamato:</strong>(frustrated)"Are you serious? We barely managed to come out alive last time. That room... it’s dangerous."</p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong>"Do we have any other option? If we don’t face this head-on, more people will die. We’ll find a clue in that room about what the students did 58 years ago to stop this. It’s the only way."</p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong>"I agree with Ema, This curse isn’t going to end by itself. If we don’t act, it’ll just keep getting worse."</p>
        <p><strong>Yamato:</strong>"Not you too, Shin... You’re really willing to risk everything for this?"</p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong>"We’ve already lost so much. If we run away now, we’ll be living in fear forever. I won’t let that happen."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="scene">
        <h2>Scene: The Revelation and the Cause</h2>
        <p>As they entered the art room, the atmosphere felt heavier than before, as if the room itself was warning them to leave. The group scanned the room for clues, the memories of Hiroshi and Rika’s deaths fresh in their minds.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, Kaito spotted something unusual. "Wait… over here!" he called, pointing to a loose floorboard. He pried it open, revealing an old, yellowed piece of paper tucked beneath. The edges were worn, and it looked fragile, as if it hadn’t been touched in decades. </p>
        <p>Ema carefully unfolded it, her breath catching in her throat as she began to read aloud.</p>
        <p><storng>“To whoever finds this, the curse can be stopped, but only by a sacrifice. Ken’s spirit is bound by pain, and he demands retribution. One must offer themselves willingly… just as we did 58 years ago.”</storng></p>
        <p>The group exchanged uneasy glances, the weight of the sacrifice sinking in. Ema continued reading, her voice trembling.</p>
        <p><strong>“The curse was dormant because Ken’s painting was restored. However, the restoration was disrupted recently when the art club reopened the old storage room and moved the painting.”</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong>(face paled)"The art club… they moved Ken’s painting."</p>
        <p><strong>His suffering was reignited by the disturbance. He feels forgotten, abandoned again. To calm his spirit and stop the deaths, his masterpiece must be found and restored, but a sacrifice must be made to seal the curse.”</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Yamato:</strong>(hands clenched into fists)"That’s why it started again… all because the painting was moved."</p>
        <p><strong>Ema:</strong>"Ken’s pain never really ended. The art club accidentally reawakened it."</p>
        <p><strong>"But that means someone must sacrifice themselves—just like the students from 58 years ago."</strong></p>        
    </div>

    <div class="scene">
        <h2>Scene:  Chaos and Sacrifice</h2>
        <p>Yamato run in hesitation from that room everyone follows him, Yamato’s voice rang out through the school's PA system, trembling as he announced, <strong>"The only way to stop the curse is... someone has to sacrifice themselves!"</strong> </p>
        <p>Panic spread like wildfire. In classrooms, hallways, and the courtyard, fear took hold. Whispers turned into accusations, and accusations morphed into violence. Students began to push and shove, eyes wide with terror as they frantically looked for someone—anyone—to offer up as the sacrifice. </p>
        <p>"You do it!" one student shouted, shoving another. </p>
        <p>"No, you!" came the retort. </p>
        <p>Fear twisted into something dark and primal. Fights broke out, students turning on each other, desperate to avoid being the chosen one. The school’s once-calm atmosphere descended into chaos, screams and cries echoing through the corridors as students battled for survival.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, Naomi rushed toward Shin and his friends, Kaigo-sensei by her side. She was pale but determined. "I’ll do it," she said, her voice cutting through the cacophony. "I’ll be the one to stop the curse."</p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong>(stunned)"Naomi, what are you saying? Why would you do this?"</p>
        <p><strong>Naomi:</strong>(hands trembling)"It’s my fault, I was the one who reactivated the curse. I followed you all to that room.... I heard the whole story because I was curious about its history. On April 2nd, I came into this building and accidentally moved that painting..."</p>
        <p>Her confession hung heavy in the air, the chaotic noise of the school fading as those around her stopped to listen. </p>
        <p><strong>Shin:</strong>"Naomi...You didn’t mean for this to happen. There must be another way!"</p>
        <p><strong>Naomi:</strong>(shook her head, tears glistening in her eyes)"No. Somebody has to do it. If it’s not me, it’ll be someone else. Or worse, more people will die. You’ve seen what this curse does."</p>
        <p><strong>Kaigo sensei:</strong>"She’s right, Shin. The only way to stop the madness is for the curse to be fulfilled."</p>
        <p><strong>Naomi:</strong>"I’m sorry for what I’ve done, but I’m ready."</p>
        <p>The group stood in stunned silence as Naomi turned toward the old building, her resolve unwavering.</p>        
    </div>

    <div class="scene">
        <h2>Scene: The Final Sacrifice</h2>
        <p>With steady steps, Naomi walked toward the old building, her heart pounding but her mind clear. The chaos around the school continued, but she focused solely on one thing: stopping the curse. Shin, Kaito, Yamato, and Ema followed her in silence, each feeling the weight of her decision. They didn’t know what to say—there was nothing left to say. Naomi had made her choice.</p>
        <p>Arriving at the cursed art room, Naomi stepped forward. "This is where it started, and this is where it has to end."</p>
        <p>She turned to face her friends one last time. "Take care of each other. Don’t let this curse destroy any more lives."</p>
        <p>Shin clenched his fists, his heart aching, but he knew he couldn’t stop her. The group watched in a mix of sorrow and helplessness as Naomi approached Ken’s painting.</p>
        <p>With a soft whisper, she offered an apology to Ken’s spirit, then, with a deep breath, she placed her hand on the canvas.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, the room filled with blinding light. Naomi’s body shuddered, and the shadows that had once swirled around the room rushed toward her, consuming her. Her final scream echoed in their ears as her form slowly faded into the light.</p>
        <p>Then, silence.</p>
        <p>The cursed air lifted, the oppressive darkness vanishing. The curse had been satisfied.</p>
        <p>The group stood there, staring at the now peaceful room, their hearts heavy with grief. The curse was broken, but at a great cost. </p>
        <p>Kaigo-sensei spoke softly, "The curse is over, but the memories of those who were lost will remain." </p>
        <p>The school, once a place of fear and death, could now begin to heal, though the weight of Naomi’s sacrifice would forever linger in their hearts. </p>
        <p>As the blinding light from Naomi’s sacrifice faded, a strange stillness enveloped the school. The chaos outside began to quiet, and students everywhere felt a sudden wave of exhaustion wash over them. One by one, they succumbed to sleep, their minds overwhelmed by the events of the day.</p>
        <p>In the old building, however, Shin, Ema, Kaito, Yamato, and Kaigo-sensei remained awake, the weight of their memories pressing heavily on their hearts. They exchanged glances, each realizing the significance of what had just transpired.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="scene">
        <h2>Scene: A New Beginning</h2>
        <p>The next day, they held a memorial for Naomi in the school courtyard. Students who had slept through the chaos gathered, their faces still bearing the shock of what they had experienced. As they shared stories about Naomi and the events leading up to her sacrifice, the gravity of the situation began to settle in.</p>
        <p>Ema stepped forward, her voice steady. "We lost a dear friend, but her sacrifice saved us all. We must remember this moment and honour what she did for us."</p>
        <p>Shin stood beside her, his expression a mixture of sadness and hope. "Naomi wouldn’t want us to dwell on the past. She would want us to move forward, to support one another and ensure that we never face such darkness again." </p>
        <p>As they laid flowers at the memorial, the students began to grasp the significance of the day. They promised to cherish their friendships and protect one another from the threats that had once plagued them.</p>
        <p>Later, as the sun set on the horizon, Ema turned to Shin, a hopeful glint in her eyes. "Even after graduation, I’d like to stay in contact. We can keep the memories of our friends alive."</p>
        <p>Shin smiled back, warmth flooding his heart. "Of course, Ema. We’ll always be there for each other."</p>
